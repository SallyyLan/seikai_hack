Make sure your writing is clear and dark enough. \\\\\n$\\bullet$ Write your NAME (first, last) on top of every non blank page of this exam. \\\\\n$\\bullet$ If you run out of space, continue your work on the back of the previous page and indicate clearly on the problem page that you have done so. \\\\\n$\\bullet$ Unless stated otherwise, you MUST justify your answers and show your work. \\\\\n$\\bullet$ Your work needs to be neat and legible.\n\n\\vspace{1cm}\n\n\\noindent Problem 1. Let $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item The linear transformation $T: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2, T(v) = Av$ is a clockwise rotation of an angle $\\theta$: what is $\\theta$?\n    \\item Does $A$ have any real eigenvalues? Justify your answer.\n    \\item Argue that if $\\alpha$ is an eigenvalue for a matrix $B$, then $\\alpha^2$ is an eigenvalue for $B^2$.\n    \\item If we consider only real (not complex) eigenvalues, is it true that if $B^2$ has real eigenvalue $\\mu$, then $B$ has real eigenvalue $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\mu}$? Explain.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\vspace{2cm}\n\n\\noindent NAME (First, Last):\n\n\\noindent Problem 2. A 1970 survey determined that 50\\% of American car owners drove large cars, 30\\% drove middle sized cars and 20\\% drove small cars. A second survey in 1980 determined that 40\\% of large car owners in 1970, still drove a large car in 1980, but 10\\% switched to a middle sized car and 50\\% switched to a small car; of the middle sized car owners in 1970, 20\\% had switched to a big car, 70\\% were still driving a middle sized car, and 10\\% were owning a small car; finally, of the small car owners in 1970, 20\\% owned a large car in 1980, 20\\% owned a middle sized car, and 60\\% still owned small cars.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Use a Markov matrix $M$ to describe this situation, that is you want to find a matrix $M$, such that\n    \\[\n    M \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5 \\\\ 0.3 \\\\ 0.2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\\\ c \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\]\n    where $a, b, c$ represent the percentages of car owners driving large, medium sized and small cars respectively in 1980.\n    \\item $\\begin{pmatrix} 0.5 \\\\ 0.7 \\\\ 0.8 \\end{pmatrix}$ is an eigenvector for $M$. What is the eigenvalue associated with it? Explain how you know.\n    \\item Assuming that every 10 years American switch cars as described above, determine the percentage of Americans that will own large, medium sized and small cars respectively in the long run.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\vspace{2cm}\n\n\\noindent Problem 3. In a hw problem you proved that if $P$ is the matrix of a projection, then $P$ is diagonalizable and the only eigenvalues of $P$ are $\\lambda = 0$ or $1$. Prove that the converse is true, that is if $A$ is a diagonalizable matrix whose only eigenvalues are 0 or 1, then $A$ is the matrix of a projection, that is $A^2 = A$.\n\n\\noindent Give an example of a matrix $A$ having no eigenvalues different from 0 and 1 which is not the matrix of a projection.\n\n\\noindent Let $W$ be $\\text{span} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$, and $V$ be the plane $x+y+z=0$. Calculate the orthogonal projections of $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ on $W$ and on $V$.\n\n\\end{document}\n```",
